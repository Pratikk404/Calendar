## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify everything works:

- [ ] Page loads at the Vercel URL
- [ ] Blue "Calendar View" text displays (Tailwind working)
- [ ] Navigation buttons render (Prev, Today, Next)
- [ ] Month/Year header displays correctly
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools
- [ ] App is responsive (works on mobile/tablet)

---

## What Happens After Deployment

### Automatic Updates
- Every push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment
- Vercel shows deployment status in GitHub (checkmarks on commits)

### Rollback if Needed
- Click previous deployment to rollback instantly
- Use "Deployments" tab to manage versions

### Monitoring
- Vercel dashboard shows analytics and errors
- Performance metrics are tracked automatically

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check that all TypeScript files compile: `npm run build` locally
- Ensure package.json exists in root directory

### App Shows Blank Page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `dist/index.html` exists after build

### CSS Not Styling
- Tailwind CSS is built into the bundle
- Should work automatically (no additional setup needed)

---

## Environment Variables (if needed later)

If you add environment variables to your app:

1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Click **"Environment Variables"**
3. Add `VITE_*` prefixed variables (Vite naming convention)
4. Redeploy to apply changes

*(Not needed for this initial deployment)*
