# 🔄 Calendar Grid Update - Need to Sync to Vercel

## 📋 Current Status

**Local Code:** ✅ Calendar grid rendering code is complete and built successfully
**GitHub Main:** ⏳ Not yet synced (git token issue)
**Vercel Live:** ⏳ Waiting for GitHub sync to redeploy

## 🎯 The Problem

The calendar grid rendering code IS in our local build but hasn't been pushed to GitHub main yet due to token authentication issues. Vercel watches GitHub main for changes and auto-deploys.

## ✅ What We Have Locally

The CalendarView.tsx has been updated to render:
- ✅ Weekday headers (Sun-Sat)
- ✅ All days of the month in proper grid
- ✅ Empty cells for days before month starts
- ✅ Hover effects and styling
- ✅ Full month navigation

## ⏳ What's Needed

The code needs to reach GitHub's main branch so Vercel can detect the change and auto-deploy.

## 🛠️ Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual Vercel Redeploy (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on **calendar-1jy2** project
3. Click **Deployments** tab
4. Find the latest deployment
5. Click the three dots (⋯) menu
6. Select **Redeploy** (without cache)
7. This will trigger a fresh build

### Option 2: Wait for Auto-Sync
The CI/CD system creates commits automatically. It may eventually push these changes to main.

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment Method
The production build (dist/ folder) is ready and could be manually deployed to any static hosting.

## 🚀 Try Option 1 First

**Manual Vercel Redeploy is your fastest path to seeing the calendar grid live!**

Once redeployed, refresh:
**https://calendar-1jy2.vercelapp**

And you should see the full calendar with all days rendered!
