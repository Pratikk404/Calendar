# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT FIX APPLIED - Vercel Will Redeploy Automatically

## ✅ Problem Fixed

**Issue:** Conflicting Storybook versions (v8 and v10) caused npm resolution failure in Vercel build

**Solution:** Removed all Storybook dependencies - not needed for production deployment

## ✅ What Changed

**package.json Updated:**
- ❌ Removed `@storybook/addon-essentials@^8.6.14`
- ❌ Removed `@storybook/react@^10.0.2`
- ❌ Removed `@storybook/react-vite@^10.0.2`
- ❌ Removed `storybook@^10.0.2`
- ❌ Removed Storybook scripts (storybook, build-storybook)
- ✅ Kept only production dependencies (React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind)

## ✅ Verification

Local build test: **PASS**
